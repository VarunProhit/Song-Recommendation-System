# Jazzam:  Sentiment Analysis Model for Song Recommendations

This project presents a sentiment analysis model designed to recommend songs based on the user's current emotional state. The model has been trained using a large dataset of four lakh labelled data points, allowing it to accurately predict sentiment with an impressive 88% accuracy rate.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** The model utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze the user's input and determine their current emotional state.
- **Song Recommendations:** Based on the detected sentiment, the model suggests songs that align with the user's emotions, creating a personalized music experience.
- **Extensive Training:** The sentiment analysis model has been trained on a massive dataset of four lakh labelled data points, ensuring its ability to accurately predict sentiments across a wide range of emotions.

## User Interface

To enhance usability, we have developed a user-friendly interface that allows users to input their current state of emotion and receive personalized song recommendations. The interface seamlessly integrates with the sentiment analysis model to provide an intuitive and engaging user experience.

We are proud to present this sentiment analysis model and its accompanying interface, aiming to bring a delightful and personalized music experience to users.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
